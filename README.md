# Welcome to _LazataknesSoftware_! 
Here you can download useful programs.

# Who am I?
I am Node.js-applications developer. I use Node.js to develop some tools, not for backend.

# Before using my tools...
1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) must be installed to use my programs.**
2. **Use Node.js portable version (Windows Binary, if you are on Windows)  to don't litter Windows Registry. Download version depending on your Windows bit depth.**
3. **People who don't know much about how a computer and operating system works will have a hard time installing my tools..**
4. **Installing some of my tools will require command line skills.**

# Tools I have developed:
* [DateNTimeChief](https://github.com/LazataknesSoftware/DateNTimeChief) **(Node.js required)** - _date and time manipulation tool_.
* Centercolor _(not loaded yet)_ **(HTML)** - _color mixing tool. Useful for legend writers._
* RGB Tester _(not loaded yet)_ **(HTML)** - _a tool for selecting colors in the form of an RGB scheme. You can get the color as a HEX scheme._
