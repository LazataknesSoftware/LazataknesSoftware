# Welcome to _LazataknesSoftware_! 
Here you can download useful programs.

> 1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) must be installed to use my programs.**
> 2. **Use Node.js portable version (Windows Binary, if you are on Windows)  to don't litter Windows Registry. Download version depending on your Windows bit depth.**
> 3. **People who don't know much about how a computer and operating system works will have a hard time installing my tools..**
> 4. **Installing some of my tools will require command line skills.**

# Tools I have developed:
* DateNTimeChief **(Node.js required)** - _date and time manipulation tool_.
* Centercolor **(HTML)** - _color mixing tool. Useful for legend writers._
* RGB Tester **(HTML)** - _a tool for selecting colors in the form of an RGB scheme. You can get the color as a HEX scheme._


> **User**: "Why should I install Node.js? Where are the installers of your programs?!"

> **LazataknesSoftware**: I personally tried to convert a JavaScript script into an executable file (program). The result was not encouraging: it was somewhere around 60 MB. If I develop 1000 projects, how much disk space will they take up? About 60 GB?! What a nightmare!\
> I decided to ask users to install an interpreter (which is 82MB) and download my tools as scripts (with a .js extension). If I develop 1000 projects, they will take up 4 MB of disk space.
